I recently finished up a bit or work in the [Ye Lab][yelab] that will soon appear in [PRL][prl]. A pre-print is available on the [arXiv][arxiv]. I'm pretty excited about it; I anticipate it to be a useful tool for strong-field physics. I know we have plans to utilize this technique for high-order harmonic generation experiments. However, I think it can be readily extended to other experiments that require aligning molecules. It may also be useful as a clever *non-resonant detection* method for looking for alignment signals of hard to detect molecules. The cavity-based approach should offer an increased sensitivity.
