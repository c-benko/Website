This is a new site I'm developing. Well, sort of... Thanks to [Jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub][git], all the hard work has been done so I can just produce something quickly. The style of this page is also not my own, but due to the work of [Gayan Virajith][gv]. Hopefully this will be a place to post things that I find interesting and would like to share.
