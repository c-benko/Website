<h1 class="text-black">Work</h1>
<p>I currently work for a small tech company in Bozeman, MT called <a href="http://www.s2corporation.com">S2 Corporation</a>. Previous to moving to Montana, I earned my Ph.D. for the University of Colorado where I worked for <a href="http://jilawww.colorado.edu/YeLabs/">Professor Jun Ye</a> at <a href="http://jila.colorado.edu">JILA</a>. I have been working as an experimental physicist since my undergraduate years at <a href="http://scu.edu">Santa Clara University</a>. There, I built my first laser and since then I have been hooked. While working for Jun Ye, I have worked on projects involving optical atomic clocks, optical frequency combs, laser stabilization schemes, and high-order harmonic generation with frequency combs. I have worked with lasers and optics at wavelengths spanning 1.5 micrometers to 50 nanometers and lasers that operate continuously or pulsed with pulse durations as shorter than 100 femtoseconds. I have measured lasers with coherence times beyond 1 second and probed physics at times scales of 100 attoseconds.</p>

<p>My current work at <a href="http://www.s2corporation.com">S2 Corporation</a> involves sensing and detecting RF and microwave signals using optical technologies and spatial-spectral holography techniques in rare-earth doped crystals held at cryogenic temperatures. We also investigate other applications of spatial-spectral holography and other RF photonic applications.</p>
