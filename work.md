I currently work for a small tech company in Bozeman, MT called [S2 Corporation][s2]. Previous to moving to Montana, I earned my Ph.D. for the University of Colorado where I worked for [Professor Jun Ye][ye] at [JILA][jila]. I have been working as an experimental physicist since my undergraduate years at [Santa Clara University][scu]. There, I built my first laser and, since then, I have been hooked. While working for Jun Ye, I have worked on projects involving optical atomic clocks, optical frequency combs, laser stabilization schemes, and high-order harmonic generation with frequency combs. I have worked with lasers and optics at wavelengths spanning 1.5 micrometers to 50 nanometers and lasers that operate continuously or pulsed with pulse durations as shorter than 100 femtoseconds. I have measured lasers with coherence times beyond 1 second and probed physics at times scales of 100 attoseconds.

My current work at [S2 Corporation][s2] involves sensing and detecting RF and microwave signals using optical technologies and spatial-spectral holography techniques in rare-earth doped crystals held at cryogenic temperatures. We also investigate other applications of spatial-spectral holography and other RF photonic applications. 

A list of my publications can be found at [Google Scholar][scholar]. Feel free to browse my [CV][cv].
