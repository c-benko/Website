I currently work for [Jun Ye][ye] in [JILA][jila]. I have been working as an experimental physicist since my undergraduate years at [Santa Clara University][scu]. There, I was able to build my first laser and since then, I have been hooked. I am pursuing a Ph.D. in experimental atomic, molecular, and optical physics. While working for Jun Ye, I have worked on projects involving optical atomic clocks, frequency comb and laser stabilization, and high-order harmonic generation with frequency combs. I have worked with lasers and optics at wavelgnths spanning 1.5 micrometers to 50 nanometers and lasers that operate continuously or pulsed with pulse durations as shorter than 100 femtoseconds. I have measured lasers with coherence times beyond 1 second and probed physics at times scales of 100 attoseconds.

A list of my publications can be found at [Google Scholar][scholar].
